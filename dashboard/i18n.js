    <h1>How to read the need score</h1>
    <p class="lede">Every hospital gets a need score for every kind of specialist, from 0 to 100.
      <b>Higher means the hospital needs that doctor more.</b> 0 means we found no sign it needs one.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="lbl l2">High need</span> 60 or more, or the hospital has zero of a doctor it is required to have.</li>
      <li><span class="lbl l1">Moderate need</span> 30 to 59.</li>
      <li><span class="lbl l0">Low need</span> under 30.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Where the points come from</h2>
    <p>The score is four checks added together. Each check can add points; none takes points away.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Missing a basic doctor: up to 35 points.</b> Every general hospital (RSU) should have an anesthesiologist, general surgeon, lab doctor (clinical pathologist), radiologist, internist, pediatrician and OB-GYN. Has none: +35. Has only one: +12, because one doctor can't be on call day and night alone. Specialty hospitals (RSIA, eye hospitals and so on) skip this check.</li>
      <li><b>Government plan needs it: up to 30 points.</b> The KMK 1277/2024 decree tells 578 government hospitals to build cancer, heart, stroke, kidney and mother-and-child services to a set level (Madya, then Utama, then Paripurna). Each level needs certain doctors. Has none: +30. Has only one at Utama or Paripurna level: +10. Private hospitals are not in the decree, so they never get these points.</li>
      <li><b>Fewer than similar hospitals: up to 15 points.</b> We compare with hospitals of the same type and size. If similar hospitals usually have 2 and this one has 0, that's +15; if it has 1, +7.5.</li>
      <li><b>Few in this area: up to 20 points.</b> We count these doctors per 100,000 people in the kab/kota. How "few" is judged is a choice in Settings (see the next section); the original rule is: none in the whole kab/kota: +20, less than half of a typical area: +12, below a typical area: +6. This only counts if the hospital should plausibly have that doctor, so a small clinic-sized hospital doesn't "need" a heart surgeon just because the area has none.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Example:</b> a 53-bed general hospital with no general surgeon gets +35 (missing a basic doctor) + 15 (similar hospitals have 1) + 12 (the area has few) = <b>62, high need</b>.</p>
    <h2 id="area">Four ways to measure "few in this area"</h2>
    <p>Pick one under <a href="#settings">Settings</a>. All four give +20, +12 or +6 points and use the same relevance check. Now in use: <b>${esc(STRINGS.en["area.name"][area])}</b>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Compared with other areas (original).</b> Doctors per 100,000 people in the kab/kota against the middle kab/kota in Indonesia. Its weak spots: "typical" is not a standard, kab/kota borders are hard edges, and when most areas have none of a rare specialty the middle value is 0, so only "none at all" can score.</li>
      <li><b>National priority targets (Kemenkes).</b> Checks the targets the government has actually set. (1) The 7 basic specialists (internal medicine, pediatrics, OB-GYN, surgery, anesthesiology, radiology, clinical pathology) are the minimum for every RSUD kab/kota; their counts at public hospitals come from Kemenkes DREAMS, the national vacancy tracker. (2) KMK 1277/2024 network hospitals need the specialists for their target tier. None in the kab/kota: +20. Only non-government hospitals have one: +12. Some covered public hospitals have none: +6. Specialties outside these targets get 0.</li>
      <li><b>Global recommended ratios.</b> Only ratios a recognised body has published: at least <b>5 anesthesiologists per 100,000 people</b> (WFSA, Kempthorne et al., Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia 2017) and <b>20 surgical, anaesthetic and obstetric specialists per 100,000</b> (Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, Meara et al. 2015; surgeons, anesthesiologists and OB-GYNs counted together). Under half the ratio: +12; below it: +6; none: +20. No such ratio exists for other specialties, so they show "n/a" instead of a guess. Indonesia's own planning target (Bappenas) of 0.28 specialists per 1,000 people covers all specialties together, so it can't be used per specialty.</li>
      <li><b>Reachable within 50 km.</b> The two-step floating catchment area method (Luo &amp; Wang 2003), common in health-access research. Each hospital's doctors are shared among the people of every kab/kota within 50 km; each kab/kota then adds up its share from all those hospitals. The result is compared with the national average (total doctors ÷ total population), which is only 0 when nobody in Indonesia has that specialist. It fixes the border problem (Bekasi can use Jakarta's doctors) and the rare-specialty problem. Distances are straight lines, so a strait or mountain range can make access look better than it is.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">The national, global and 50 km options count the 7 basic specialists at public hospitals from Kemenkes DREAMS where it covers them, because SIRS often reports none where DREAMS lists one. SIRS counts a doctor at every hospital where they work, so all per-100,000 figures run high; this matters most for the global ratios.</p>
    <h2 id="limits">How accurate is this data?</h2>
    <p>Good enough to see patterns, not to trust one hospital's numbers without checking. All sources are filled in by hospitals and doctors themselves in government systems; nobody has verified them on the ground.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>The two government sources mostly agree.</b> For the 7 basic specialists at public hospitals, SIRS and Kemenkes DREAMS are within one doctor of each other in ${acc.within1.toLocaleString()} of ${acc.pairs.toLocaleString()} cases (${Math.round(acc.within1 / Math.max(acc.pairs, 1) * 100)}%). Their totals also match the figures Kemenkes publishes.</li>
      <li><b>About 1 in 5 "missing doctor" flags may be false.</b> Of ${acc.high} high-need flags for basic specialists at public hospitals, ${acc.contradicted} (${acc.share}%) come from SIRS saying zero while DREAMS says at least one. Check these before acting.</li>
      <li><b>Private hospitals can't be cross-checked.</b> ${acc.priv.toLocaleString()} of ${D.hospitals.length.toLocaleString()} hospitals are private, and only SIRS covers them.</li>
      <li><b>"Has 1" may mean a visiting doctor.</b> SIRS counts a doctor at every hospital where they work. In Java there are about 2.6 hospital posts per orthopedic surgeon.</li>
      <li><b>Some records are wrong or old.</b> For example, RSUD Galesong (Takalar) stopped services in May 2025 but is still listed as staffed. ${D.quality.approx_location} hospitals have no usable map location and ${D.quality.missing_beds.length} have no bed count.</li>
      <li><b>"Need" is not a job opening.</b> The score knows nothing about patient numbers, budgets or whether the hospital is hiring.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="table-wrap"><table><thead><tr><th>What you want to know</th><th>How much to trust it</th></tr></thead><tbody>
      <tr><td>Which specialties are scarce, nationally or by province</td><td>Good</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Which areas lack a specialty</td><td>Fairly good</td></tr>

    <p>The spot check under Data quality measures the real error rate as hospitals are called.</p>
    <h2>What the law does and doesn't say</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>No regulation sets a required number of specialists.</b> The laws name services a hospital must offer, not doctors.</li>
      <li><b>PP 28/2024 (Pasal 821)</b> lists services every hospital must offer, such as surgery, intensive care, a lab and radiology.</li>
      <li><b>Permenkes 3/2020 (Pasal 8)</b> names four basic specialties: internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery and OB-GYN.</li>
      <li><b>KMK 1277/2024</b> sets the government's cancer, heart, stroke, kidney and mother-and-child targets for 578 hospitals.</li>
      <li>Turning "this hospital must offer surgery" into "this hospital needs a surgeon and an anesthesiologist" is this tool's own judgment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Limits to keep in mind</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Doctor counts come from SIRS, where hospitals report their own staff. They can be out of date, and a doctor who works at three hospitals is counted at all three.</li>
      <li>Private hospitals can score at most 70, because the government-plan check doesn't apply to them. To compare a private and a government hospital, look at the need level and the reasons, not the raw number.</li>
      <li>Population comes from Dukcapil (Kemendagri), not BPS.</li>
      <li>The point values are a first version. Check them against hospitals you know and adjust.</li>

    <h1>Cara membaca skor kebutuhan</h1>
    <p class="lede">Setiap rumah sakit mendapat skor kebutuhan untuk setiap jenis spesialis, dari 0 sampai 100.
      <b>Makin tinggi berarti rumah sakit makin membutuhkan dokter itu.</b> 0 berarti tidak ditemukan tanda kebutuhan.</p>
    <ul>

      <li><span class="lbl l0">Kebutuhan rendah</span> di bawah 30.</li>

    <h2>Dari mana poinnya</h2>
    <p>Skor adalah jumlah empat pengecekan. Setiap pengecekan hanya bisa menambah poin, tidak mengurangi.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Tidak ada dokter dasar: maksimal 35 poin.</b> Setiap rumah sakit umum (RSU) seharusnya punya dokter spesialis anestesi, bedah, patologi klinik, radiologi, penyakit dalam, anak, dan kandungan. Tidak ada: +35. Hanya satu: +12, karena satu dokter tidak bisa jaga siang dan malam sendirian. Rumah sakit khusus (RSIA, RS mata, dan sebagainya) tidak melalui pengecekan ini.</li>
      <li><b>Dibutuhkan rencana pemerintah: maksimal 30 poin.</b> KMK 1277/2024 menugaskan 578 rumah sakit pemerintah membangun layanan kanker, jantung, stroke, ginjal, serta ibu dan anak sampai tingkat tertentu (Madya, lalu Utama, lalu Paripurna). Setiap tingkat membutuhkan dokter tertentu. Tidak ada: +30. Hanya satu di tingkat Utama atau Paripurna: +10. Rumah sakit swasta tidak termasuk dalam keputusan ini, jadi tidak pernah mendapat poin ini.</li>
      <li><b>Lebih sedikit dari RS serupa: maksimal 15 poin.</b> Dibandingkan dengan rumah sakit sejenis dan seukuran. Jika RS serupa biasanya punya 2 dan RS ini punya 0, itu +15; jika punya 1, +7,5.</li>
      <li><b>Sedikit di wilayah ini: maksimal 20 poin.</b> Dihitung jumlah dokter ini per 100.000 penduduk di kab/kota. Cara menilai "sedikit" bisa dipilih di Pengaturan (lihat bagian berikutnya); aturan aslinya: tidak ada sama sekali di kab/kota: +20, kurang dari separuh daerah pada umumnya: +12, di bawah daerah pada umumnya: +6. Ini hanya dihitung jika rumah sakit memang wajar punya dokter itu, jadi RS kecil tidak dianggap "butuh" dokter bedah jantung hanya karena di daerahnya tidak ada.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Contoh:</b> rumah sakit umum 53 tempat tidur tanpa dokter spesialis bedah mendapat +35 (tidak ada dokter dasar) + 15 (RS serupa punya 1) + 12 (di wilayahnya sedikit) = <b>62, kebutuhan tinggi</b>.</p>
    <h2 id="area">Empat cara mengukur "sedikit di wilayah ini"</h2>
    <p>Pilih salah satu di <a href="#settings">Pengaturan</a>. Keempatnya memberi +20, +12, atau +6 poin dan memakai pengecekan relevansi yang sama. Sedang dipakai: <b>${esc(STRINGS.id["area.name"][area])}</b>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Dibanding daerah lain (asli).</b> Dokter per 100.000 penduduk di kab/kota dibanding kab/kota nilai tengah di Indonesia. Kelemahannya: "pada umumnya" bukan standar, batas kab/kota menjadi tembok, dan jika sebagian besar daerah tidak punya spesialis langka, nilai tengahnya 0, jadi hanya "tidak ada sama sekali" yang mendapat poin.</li>
      <li><b>Target prioritas nasional (Kemenkes).</b> Mengecek target yang benar-benar ditetapkan pemerintah. (1) 7 dokter spesialis dasar (penyakit dalam, anak, kandungan, bedah, anestesi, radiologi, patologi klinik) adalah standar minimal setiap RSUD kab/kota; jumlahnya di RS pemerintah diambil dari Kemenkes DREAMS, pemantau kekosongan nasional. (2) RS jejaring KMK 1277/2024 membutuhkan dokter untuk tingkat targetnya. Tidak ada di kab/kota: +20. Hanya ada di RS non-pemerintah: +12. Sebagian RS pemerintah yang dicakup tidak punya: +6. Spesialis di luar target ini mendapat 0.</li>
      <li><b>Rasio rekomendasi global.</b> Hanya rasio yang diterbitkan lembaga yang diakui: minimal <b>5 dokter anestesi per 100.000 penduduk</b> (WFSA, Kempthorne dkk., Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia 2017) dan <b>20 dokter spesialis bedah, anestesi, dan kandungan per 100.000</b> (Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, Meara dkk. 2015; dihitung bersama). Kurang dari separuh rasio: +12; di bawahnya: +6; tidak ada: +20. Spesialis lain tidak punya rasio seperti ini, jadi ditampilkan "n/a" alih-alih ditebak. Target perencanaan Indonesia sendiri (Bappenas) 0,28 dokter spesialis per 1.000 penduduk mencakup semua spesialis sekaligus, jadi tidak bisa dipakai per spesialis.</li>
      <li><b>Terjangkau dalam 50 km.</b> Metode two-step floating catchment area (Luo &amp; Wang 2003) yang umum dalam riset akses kesehatan. Dokter di setiap RS dibagi untuk penduduk semua kab/kota dalam radius 50 km; lalu setiap kab/kota menjumlahkan bagiannya dari semua RS itu. Hasilnya dibandingkan dengan rata-rata nasional (total dokter ÷ total penduduk), yang hanya 0 jika tidak ada satu pun dokter spesialis itu di Indonesia. Ini mengatasi masalah batas wilayah (Bekasi bisa memakai dokter Jakarta) dan masalah spesialis langka. Jarak dihitung garis lurus, jadi selat atau pegunungan bisa membuat akses terlihat lebih baik dari kenyataannya.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Pilihan nasional, global, dan 50 km menghitung 7 dokter spesialis dasar di RS pemerintah dari Kemenkes DREAMS jika tercakup, karena SIRS sering mencatat nol padahal DREAMS mencatat ada. SIRS menghitung dokter di setiap RS tempat ia bekerja, jadi semua angka per 100.000 cenderung tinggi; ini paling berpengaruh pada rasio global.</p>
    <h2 id="limits">Seberapa akurat data ini?</h2>
    <p>Cukup untuk melihat pola, tetapi angka satu rumah sakit jangan dipercaya tanpa dicek. Semua sumber diisi sendiri oleh rumah sakit dan dokter di sistem pemerintah; belum ada yang memverifikasi di lapangan.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Kedua sumber pemerintah umumnya sama.</b> Untuk 7 spesialis dasar di RS pemerintah, SIRS dan Kemenkes DREAMS selisihnya paling banyak satu dokter pada ${acc.within1.toLocaleString("id-ID")} dari ${acc.pairs.toLocaleString("id-ID")} kasus (${Math.round(acc.within1 / Math.max(acc.pairs, 1) * 100)}%). Totalnya juga sesuai dengan angka yang diterbitkan Kemenkes.</li>
      <li><b>Sekitar 1 dari 5 tanda "dokter tidak ada" mungkin salah.</b> Dari ${acc.high} tanda kebutuhan tinggi untuk spesialis dasar di RS pemerintah, ${acc.contradicted} (${acc.share}%) berasal dari SIRS yang bilang nol padahal DREAMS bilang minimal satu. Cek dulu sebelum bertindak.</li>
      <li><b>RS swasta tidak bisa dicek silang.</b> ${acc.priv.toLocaleString("id-ID")} dari ${D.hospitals.length.toLocaleString("id-ID")} rumah sakit adalah swasta, dan hanya SIRS yang mencakupnya.</li>
      <li><b>"Punya 1" bisa berarti dokter tamu.</b> SIRS menghitung dokter di setiap rumah sakit tempat ia bekerja. Di Jawa ada sekitar 2,6 posisi RS per dokter spesialis ortopedi.</li>
      <li><b>Sebagian data salah atau usang.</b> Contohnya, RSUD Galesong (Takalar) berhenti melayani sejak Mei 2025 tetapi masih tercatat punya staf. ${D.quality.approx_location} rumah sakit tidak punya lokasi peta yang bisa dipakai dan ${D.quality.missing_beds.length} tidak punya jumlah tempat tidur.</li>
      <li><b>"Kebutuhan" bukan lowongan kerja.</b> Skor ini tidak tahu jumlah pasien, anggaran, atau apakah rumah sakit sedang merekrut.</li>

    <h2>Apa yang diatur dan tidak diatur hukum</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Tidak ada aturan yang menetapkan jumlah wajib dokter spesialis.</b> Aturan menyebut layanan yang wajib ada, bukan dokternya.</li>
      <li><b>PP 28/2024 (Pasal 821)</b> menyebut layanan yang wajib ada di setiap rumah sakit, seperti bedah, perawatan intensif, laboratorium, dan radiologi.</li>
      <li><b>Permenkes 3/2020 (Pasal 8)</b> menyebut empat spesialis dasar: penyakit dalam, anak, bedah, dan kandungan.</li>
      <li><b>KMK 1277/2024</b> menetapkan target layanan kanker, jantung, stroke, ginjal, serta ibu dan anak untuk 578 rumah sakit.</li>
      <li>Menerjemahkan "rumah sakit ini wajib punya layanan bedah" menjadi "rumah sakit ini butuh dokter bedah dan dokter anestesi" adalah penilaian alat ini sendiri.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Batasan yang perlu diingat</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Jumlah dokter berasal dari SIRS, tempat rumah sakit melaporkan stafnya sendiri. Bisa usang, dan dokter yang bekerja di tiga rumah sakit dihitung di ketiganya.</li>
      <li>RS swasta maksimal mendapat skor 70, karena pengecekan rencana pemerintah tidak berlaku. Untuk membandingkan RS swasta dan pemerintah, lihat tingkat kebutuhan dan alasannya, bukan angka mentahnya.</li>
      <li>Data penduduk berasal dari Dukcapil (Kemendagri), bukan BPS.</li>
      <li>Nilai poin ini versi pertama. Cocokkan dengan rumah sakit yang Anda kenal lalu sesuaikan.</li>
